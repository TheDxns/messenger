# Basic Messenger (work in progress)
Basic chat web application with real time text communication.<br />
Created with use of Spring Boot, Vaadin, RabbitMQ and WebSockets.<br />
It allows to send private messages to other users and create group chats.

The app is in early development stage right now.<br />
Once I have a working build I will make it available via Heroku and post a link here.
